# DateTime Step Component - Refactored

This directory contains the refactored DateTime Step component, broken down into smaller, more maintainable pieces.

## Structure

```

├── index.tsx                    # Main component entry point
├── types.ts                     # TypeScript interfaces and types

│   ├── CustomCalendar.tsx      # Calendar widget
│   ├── DateSelector.tsx        # Date selection card
│   ├── TimeSelector.tsx        # Time slot selection card
│   └── BookingSummary.tsx      # Booking confirmation summary
└── hooks/
    └── useDateTimeStep.ts      # Business logic and state management
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- **UI Components**: Pure presentational components in `components/`
- **Business Logic**: Extracted to custom hook `useDateTimeStep`
- **Type Definitions**: Centralized in `types.ts`

### 2. **Reusability**

- Components can be easily reused in other parts of the application
- Custom hook can be shared across different UI implementations
- Clear interfaces make testing easier

### 3. **Maintainability**

- Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- Clear boundaries between different responsibilities
- Better error handling and TypeScript support

### 4. **Performance**

- Optimized React hooks with proper dependency arrays
- Memoized callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient state management

## Components

### DateTimeStepHeader

Simple header component with title and description.

### CustomCalendar

Self-contained calendar widget with navigation and date selection.

### DateSelector

Card component that wraps the calendar with appropriate styling and descriptions.

### TimeSelector

Complex component that handles time slot display, loading states, and availability checking.

### BookingSummary

Confirmation component that shows the selected date and time.

## Hooks

### useDateTimeStep

Central hook that manages:

- Date and time selection state
- Service availability fetching
- Professional schedule management
- Time slot generation and validation
- Event handlers for user interactions

## Usage

```tsx
import { DateTimeStep } from "./datetime-step";

// Use as before - the API remains the same
<DateTimeStep />;
```

The refactored component maintains the same external API while providing better internal organization and maintainability.
